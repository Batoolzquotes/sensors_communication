To configure the MLX90614 infrared temperature sensor, MPX5010DP pressure sensor, and MAX30102 pulse oximeter sensor with a 20x4 TFT display and Arduino Uno, follow these steps:

Connect the MLX90614 sensor to the Arduino Uno as follows:

Connect the MLX90614's VCC pin to the Arduino's 3.3V or 5V pin.
Connect the MLX90614's GND pin to the Arduino's GND pin.
Connect the MLX90614's SDA pin to the Arduino's A4 pin (SDA).
Connect the MLX90614's SCL pin to the Arduino's A5 pin (SCL).
Connect the MPX5010DP sensor to the Arduino Uno as follows:

Connect the MPX5010DP's VCC pin to the Arduino's 5V pin.
Connect the MPX5010DP's GND pin to the Arduino's GND pin.
Connect the MPX5010DP's Vout pin to the Arduino's analog input pin (e.g., A0).
Connect the MAX30102 sensor to the Arduino Uno as follows:

Connect the MAX30102's VCC pin to the Arduino's 3.3V or 5V pin.
Connect the MAX30102's GND pin to the Arduino's GND pin.
Connect the MAX30102's SDA pin to the Arduino's A4 pin (SDA).
Connect the MAX30102's SCL pin to the Arduino's A5 pin (SCL).
Connect the 20x4 TFT display to the Arduino Uno. The specific connections will depend on the display's interface (e.g., I2C, SPI, or parallel). Assuming you are using an I2C interface, follow these connections:

Connect the display's VCC pin to the Arduino's 5V pin.
Connect the display's GND pin to the Arduino's GND pin.
Connect the display's SDA pin to the Arduino's A4 pin (SDA).
Connect the display's SCL pin to the Arduino's A5 pin (SCL).
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed for the MLX90614, MPX5010DP, MAX30102, and TFT display. These libraries provide functions to communicate with the respective sensors and display data.

Include the necessary library headers in your Arduino code:
